# {Hello algorithms-community} 

Welcome to the Repo to hold all things related to our algorithms community! 

Begining in early 2017 we will have a monthly meetup for our members to get together and work developing their problem solving skills by collectively tacking algorithms and data structures problems! 

All levels are welcome!
